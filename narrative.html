                <p>Listening to podcasts is becoming a part of daily routine for many people. However, the current podcasts navigation tools are barely satisfactory. A photo and a long text of description are used to represent a podcast series. Users are having a hard time navigating through the interface. In addition, locating topics within a certain episode podcast is hard but highly desired by the users. Also, browsing topics within an episode regarding time is a useful task for users, which cannot be done by current system. We would expect something that comes handy.</p>
                <p>By implementing our design, firstly we select episode 80 of podcast: Modern Health Show, 15 minutes of the audio is selected as the raw data, several topics and the associated key words are derived from the transcript.</p>
                <p>Target user: Out end-user is Prof. Metoyer, but we expect our design will be accepted by most people who are interested in listening to podcast.</p>
