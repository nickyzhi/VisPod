				<h2>Research Experience</h2>
				
				<h3><a href="http://int.bupt.edu.cn/">Intelligent Network Center</a></h3>
				
				
				Our work started with the awareness of insufficiency and scattered nature
of heterogeneous information from many topic models including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which is raised
by the overpassing of inner relations within network structures. Then Multi-type Topic Model (MTTM), which uses
Gibbs sampling method and a joint different topics framework, is proposed to integrate multi-type topics learning. The
benefits were clear, besides learning that the topics fall into the same type of object, the interactions among different
types are also taken into consideration. The experimental results on DBLP also proved MTTM with high learning
quality.

                
				<h3><a href="http://speech.tsinghua.edu.cn/Eng/intro-en.htm">Multimedia Signal and Intelligent Information Processing Laboratory(MSIIP)</a></h3>
				
				 I participated in the TAC (text analysis conferen ce) Knowledge Base Population (KBP)
entity linking track with the goal of extracting named entities from a source collection of textual documents and linking them to an existing Knowledge Base (KB). After extensive laboratory work and studying theory, I revised extant
Stanford and UIUC tools for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and utilized it to extract entity from given material.
The results already showed a high rank of recall (2/20). Based on the basic method of learning to rank, we went a
step further by proposing a new method to maximize the relation between query and target entities, which included
an iterative process to add collective features. A high rank of F1 (4/20) was observed as the result. The chance of
presenting this exciting work in TAC hardened my will to develop my career as a researcher.
