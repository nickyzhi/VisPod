Welcome to The Model Health Show, this is fitness and nutrition expert, Shawn Stevenson, here with my cohost and producer, the amazing Jade Harrell. What's up Jade? What's up Shawn? How are you doing today? Man, what an intro you just made. I am fantastonishing! Fantastonishing? Break that down for me, what is that? Fantastically astonishing or astonishingly fantastic. Either way, I like it. It's like the reversible cap. You get two different styles in one cap. Awesome, awesome. Well, glad to hear that.  And everybody, thank you so much for tuning in. We've got an amazing show for you today. Today we're going to be talking about how to boost your sex hormones. Well, we'll take that. In particular, we're going to be talking about how to boost testosterone naturally. Testosterone is important for men and women. I was just going to say, is this for the guys today?
Yeah, it's a far deeper thing than just about sex. It's really about a lot of other important  and fundamental things for us to be healthy and fit long term.  Testosterone is a big player in that so we're going to talk all about that.  I'm also going to be wrapping the show up  by sharing with you ten ways to boost your testosterone naturally. Okay.
And many of these things are the price of free.  You know, my favorite price.  So, stay tuned for that  but first let's give a shout out to our show sponsor, onnit.com. Head over to onnit.com/model for 10% all your health and human performance supplements. If you don't know by now you've got to get the Hemp FORCE. Hemp protein is the most bioavailable protein for the human body. If you're going to be somebody who's operating at a high level, working out, getting your train on, getting your body together,  you need some high-quality protein and hemp is the way to go.  You are not going to be dealing with all the nefarious,  kind of sketchy stuff as you move up the food chain. You're dealing with, what did that cow eat that I'm drinking.  Of course, if you get whey protein it's going to be from 5,000 cows. And I'm just saying, they are not keeping food diaries, okay.
Exactly. So all of those immunological factors can potentially  cause an autoimmune response in your body.  I'm not saying that for all whey proteins  but the standard stuff out there  is not the best so we're going to cut away that whole pathway  and get onto something of a higher quality, that good plant-based protein so you're not going to be worrying about toxins working their way up the food chain. It will be lower toxicity.  Also, it's organic too so you're not dealing with pesticides, fungicides.  It's estrogenic compounds, by the way,  since we're talking about building testosterone. These things, when you're dealing with pesticides can actually hurt your test.  So we're going to call testosterone, we're going to shorten it today and call it test. Test, we're going to call it test.
So definitely get your hands on some Hemp FORCE protein.  We love the vanilla acai and the choco maca. Both flavors are incredible. Yes they are. Also, the SHROOM Tech. That's a pre-workout.  Or, as Jade says, a pre- life.  It gets your energy right, nice, natural consistent energy.  You're not going to be spiked out like Spike Lee trying to trip referees, you know.  You're going to feel good and consistent.  And it is coming from something that's got 5,000 years of documented history  in Chinese medicine so it's been around a while. I love it.
Also, with the news clinical studies today showing its impact  on oxygenating your blood, boosting stamina, improving your insulin sensitivity  which means less belly fat, it's really powerful stuff.  We're talking about cordyceps mushroom  and that's the basis of the SHROOM Tech formula so those are two incredible things. They've got a lot more so head over there  and check them out, onnit.com/model for 10% off. Now let's get into the iTunes review of the week Here's a five-star rating Shawn which we so love to receive.  It says, 'Awesome podcast. One of the best.' From Howard H. 'I heard an interview of Shawn on the Smart Passive Income podcast. I was so glad I started listening.  I bought his Sleep Smarter book twice,  one for me and the other for my daughter. I've been enjoying his podcast from the first one.  There is so much good information that I can't stop listening.' Wow, that is incredible. That worked. That's incredible. Spreading the love. Yes.
The LUV. I love it. Thank you so much.  Thank you so much for leaving that review  and everybody thanks for heading over to iTunes  and leaving reviews for the show.  That means so much.  It makes my day every single time I open those up  we’re going to talk about what is testosterone in the first place. We’ve got to define it. And if it’s such a widespread problem, this is…we need to know.
So testosterone is essentially a steroid hormone. It’s part of an androgen group. The androgen groups are essentially known as the male hormones. This is what makes men more masculine and  also helps to facilitate a lot of other functions in females as well. Testosterone is secreted primarily by the testicles of males and the ovaries of females. But a small amount is secreted from the adrenal glands as well.  Okay, so now that we’ve gotten a little bit of a definition let’s talk about what testosterone does. So, testosterone really, the most important, fundamental thing is that before birth  it determines whether or not a baby will develop into a boy or a girl. How about that. Now a lot of people don’t realize this but we all start off as girls.  We all start off in the womb… Who runs the world, girls, who runs the world, girls. Cue Beyoncé. We all start off in the womb with the female template. How about that.
So basically, after the egg gets fertilized, the sperm and egg meet, there are different phases, the zygote, fetus, and this whole thing.  But there comes a point where there’s a big shed of testosterone  from the mother to the fetus that results in the dropping down of the testicles.  Basically, for women, the ovaries kind of stay up there.  For guys, they drop down and become the testicles. That is so amazing. Isn’t that crazy? It is crazy. So they’re the same thing, just an innie and an outie. Exactly! And one of them is more dangerous. Out in the world you’ve got  to protect them. It’s a whole different ballgame. Which goes back to that valuable womb.
And also, this is the sprouting or the birth of the penis as well due to that.  And, of course, the different chromosome is determined by the father  but the testosterone level in the mother is also important in how big these things get or how much testosterone the baby is going to have. So it all kind of sets your template early in life as to what your genetic disposition is going to be. However, with that said, genes only play a  certain percentage of the role in your testosterone because you have a lot of influence in your testosterone levels in what you do in your day to day life. Just to make that kind of short and sweet and to end it right there  because we could talk about that the entire show, is that testosterone is literally what makes you a male when you’re developing. Sure, but then it continues to be an influence throughout your lifetime, that we have some more control over. Exactly. And in adult males, their level of testosterone is about  seven to eight times greater than adult females. Really?
Now there are different degrees of that depending on where they are  in the day, depending on a lot of different factors, because it can  be as great as 20 times as much. But still, I want to make the point that women have testosterone too and it’s very, very important  for your health and longevity. So testosterone is also important regulating the sex drive in men and women.  It’s important for starting and maintaining the development of male sex  characteristics including emotional and physical strength, the body shape, hairiness, deepness of the voice, and even the way you smell, your odor. Odor. It also governs sperm production and quality. It governs your ability to perform during sexual intercourse. Testosterone also plays a role in developing your creativity, intellect, and by the way, this is all backed by clinical studies. So it has a role in developing your creativity, your intellect, your thought patterns,  your drive, your assertiveness. We all know this, men and women, as well as the ability to propose new ideas and to carry them out to their conclusion. So that’s that quality of drive. Are you a driver? Testosterone does play a role in that because you can only talk yourself up so much. But are you following through?  Your testosterone levels could be an influencing player in that. That’s very interesting. High five to testosterone for all that.
Right. Also, testosterone plays a role in bone maturation and bone density. Also, your muscle mass. This is captain obvious here A lot of people know that one. Protein synthesis. So your body actually building things, breaking down proteins and making it into other stuff. That is so critical. You are a protein being.  Testosterone plays a role in this. It is also a regulator of cognitive and physical energy. So, like your brain health. We’re also going to talk about some of the negative things if you don’t have optimal testosterone levels. Testosterone is also responsible for acute stress response. So, how are you under stress. How are you reacting? Are you going to be more driven to get things done, to accomplish that goal even when stress shows up,or are you going to retreat? Your testosterone does have a huge impact on that. So now that you know a little bit about what testosterone does in your body and in your friends’ body, your partner, mother, father, brother, everybody that you know, it’s impacting them. Now that you understand a little bit about what it does I’m going to share with you the process of how it’s actually created. Now you’ve got to get your science pants on.  Get your pocket protector. No, we’re not going to make it too complicated. But I am going to take you through the biochemical process here. Now here’s what low testosterone can mean for your. According to  clinical studies, men whose testosterone levels are slightly above average are less likely to have high blood pressure, less likely to experience a heart attack, and less likely to be obese. Give that man some testosterone then.
Low testosterone means increased heart disease, increased osteoporosis, diabetes, brain aging. This is seen in the research, accelerated brain aging form low testosterone, and shorter life span. Now,  infertility and poor reproductive health also mean more belly fat and total body fat compared to your lean muscle mass, less muscle growth from the strength training you’re doing. So, if you’re out there busting it and working out and training and not really getting the results it might be something to consider that your testosterone might be low. Also, obviously, poorer athletic performance. So, your athletic performance will suffer because you don’t have that drive, you don’t have that extra gear. You also have slower recovery from your intense training. And, the headline here is that you’ll have a greater risk of cancer when testosterone levels are low. So，let’s talk about some of the things that can lower the testosterone. First, we’ll start with some of the obvious stuff. The testosterone can be damaged, especially leydig cells, during sports or other physical trauma. So, if any guy out there, which pretty much all of us have had that  experience of getting nailed in the balls and it’s like... Does it really hurt like that? I mean, it hurts like that? It feels like somebody is choking you out. It’s so crazy how it’s connected. It’s pretty bad. Well, if the testicles are...You are doing the hands like....
Maybe I should change the shape. Well, if the testicles are similar to our ovaries except that yours are exposed to dangerous environmental factors and trauma then the only thing I can equate the pain that you are describing to is maybe our monthly cramping that happens. You know, the thing is, if you look into this you really can’t find a comparison. There’s not, huh? Men are from Mars, women are from Venus? Right. We will never really understand, because we have not gone through it. Sure And you guys can’t really understand what it’s like for us as well. And there’s no language to... Nobody’s pain is more important. No, no-no-no. Who would even bring up childbirth and all that stuff. We wouldn’t even go there. Let’s not get into a debate. There’s no need.
So I want people to understand that physical trauma can definitely  hinder your testosterone level production for sure. So, kids out there who are playing sports, collegiate sports, professional athletes, we’ve got some professional athletes who listen to the show,  make sure that you wear the protection, okay.  Jade just tapped a cup. It was a Styrofoam cup. I don’t know where that came from. But, anyway, protect yourself. Yes, protect yourself.
Also, radiation treatment or chemotherapy has been shown, clinically proven, to have negative effects on the leydig cells. There we  are again about the leydig cells. Vasectomy may damage the leydig cells and lead to early andropause and low testosterone levels. Several studies have shown this. So you’ve got to be careful when we’re making that decision about getting the vasectomy, getting the little clippie clippie so we don’t have any more babies, because you could be potentially lowering your testosterone levels. Right, try another way. Yeah. We’ve actually talked about some natural birth control methods on the show with Sara Gottfried.	 We did.
But this is again, understanding we want to things as natural as possible. Surgery should be far down the line as an option for you because  every surgery is a traumatic even for the human body. Your body is not designed to be cut into so just understand that. We are finding more and more just how much trauma affects our well being.
Yeah, If you’ve got neighbors who it’s not going to really work for that’s  something you’ve got to consider maybe doing a different way but I’m just giving you the data here. Sunlight on the testicles directly can boost your testosterone even more so than getting it on  your other body parts. So let the sunshine in. 
That’s tip number one to naturally boost your testosterone, get more sunlight. Tip number two is to lift heavy weights. This is the well-known one. This is known across the board  so we’re not going to spend a lot of time here, but heavy lifts.  We’re talking about doing heavy lifting here. So, especially the compound lifts, the dead lifts, the squats, overhead press, bench press. These are going to trigger your body to secrete the most anabolic hormones.  So these lifts are critical to secreting testosterone. So the dead lift the squats, bench press, and overhead press, and anything that you’re putting a heavy load on your body., so this is gonna be the thing... Number three on our ten ways to naturally boost testosterone is sex.  There you go.
Orgasm does not actually affect testosterone levels in the blood in an acute sense. So, just the short-term secretion, because  a lot of guys are actually concerned that there is a lot of information out there, even movies saying you can’t do it when you are training for your event because you are going to depress your drive because our drive is related to our testosterone. But there is not really much data to back that up.
