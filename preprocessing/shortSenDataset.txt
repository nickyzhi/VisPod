shawn;00:00:14;Welcome to The Model Health Show, this is fitness and nutrition expert,
shawn;00:00:18;Shawn Stevenson, here with my cohost and producer,
shawn;00:00:20;the amazing Jade Harrell. What's up Jade?
Jade;00:00:23;What's up Shawn?
shawn;00:00:25;How are you doing today?
Jade;00:00:26;Man, what an intro you just made. I am fantastonishing!
shawn;00:00:31;Fantastonishing? Break that down for me, what is that?
Jade;00:00:35;Fantastically astonishing or astonishingly fantastic.
shawn;00:00:39;Either way, I like it. It's like the reversible cap.
shawn;00:00:43;You get two different styles in one cap. Awesome, awesome.
Jade;00:00:48;Well, glad to hear that. 
shawn;00:00:49;And everybody, thank you so much for tuning in.
shawn;00:00:50;We've got an amazing show for you today.
shawn;00:00:53;Today we're going to be talking about how to boost your sex hormones.
Jade;00:00:56;Well, we'll take that.
shawn;00:00:57;In particular, we're going to be talking about how to boost testosterone naturally.
shawn;00:01:01;Testosterone is important for men and women.
Jade;00:01:03;I was just going to say, is this for the guys today?
shawn;00:01:06;Yeah, it's a far deeper thing than just about sex.
shawn;00:01:10;It's really about a lot of other important 
shawn;00:01:13;and fundamental things for us to be healthy and fit long term. 
shawn;00:01:17;Testosterone is a big player in that so we're going to talk all about that. 
shawn;00:01:19;I'm also going to be wrapping the show up 
shawn;00:01:20;by sharing with you ten ways to boost your testosterone naturally.
Jade;00:01:24;Okay.
shawn;00:01:25;And many of these things are the price of free. 
shawn;00:01:28;You know, my favorite price. 
shawn;00:01:31;So, stay tuned for that 
shawn;00:01:32;but first let's give a shout out to our show sponsor, onnit.com.
shawn;00:01:36;Head over to onnit.com/model for 10% all your health and human performance supplements.
shawn;00:01:46;If you don't know by now you've got to get the Hemp FORCE.
shawn;00:01:50;Hemp protein is the most bioavailable protein for the human body.
shawn;00:01:53;If you're going to be somebody who's operating at a high level,
shawn;00:01:56;working out, getting your train on, getting your body together, 
shawn;00:01:59;you need some high-quality protein and hemp is the way to go. 
shawn;00:02:03;You are not going to be dealing with all the nefarious, 
shawn;00:02:06;kind of sketchy stuff as you move up the food chain.
shawn;00:02:09;You're dealing with, what did that cow eat that I'm drinking. 
shawn;00:02:11;Of course, if you get whey protein it's going to be from 5,000 cows.
Jade;00:02:15;And I'm just saying, they are not keeping food diaries, okay.
shawn;00:02:19;Exactly. So all of those immunological factors can potentially 
shawn;00:02:24;cause an autoimmune response in your body. 
shawn;00:02:26;I'm not saying that for all whey proteins 
shawn;00:02:27;but the standard stuff out there 
shawn;00:02:29;is not the best so we're going to cut away that whole pathway 
shawn;00:02:33;and get onto something of a higher quality,
shawn;00:02:35;that good plant-based protein so you're not going to be worrying about
shawn;00:02:38;toxins working their way up the food chain.
shawn;00:02:41;It will be lower toxicity. 
shawn;00:02:43;Also, it's organic too so you're not dealing with pesticides, fungicides. 
shawn;00:02:46;It's estrogenic compounds, by the way, 
shawn;00:02:49;since we're talking about building testosterone.
shawn;00:02:52;These things, when you're dealing with pesticides can actually hurt your test. 
shawn;00:02:56;So we're going to call testosterone,
shawn;00:02:57;we're going to shorten it today and call it test.
Jade;00:02:59;Test, we're going to call it test.
shawn;00:03:01;So definitely get your hands on some Hemp FORCE protein. 
shawn;00:03:04;We love the vanilla acai and the choco maca.
shawn;00:03:06;Both flavors are incredible.
shawn;00:03:07;Yes they are.
shawn;00:03:09;Also, the SHROOM Tech. That's a pre-workout. 
shawn;00:03:12;Or, as Jade says, a pre- life. 
shawn;00:03:13;It gets your energy right, nice, natural consistent energy. 
shawn;00:03:17;You're not going to be spiked out like Spike Lee trying to trip referees, you know. 
shawn;00:03:22;You're going to feel good and consistent. 
shawn;00:03:24;And it is coming from something that's got 5,000 years of documented history 
shawn;00:03:27;in Chinese medicine so it's been around a while.
Jade;00:03:30;I love it.
shawn;00:03:31;Also, with the news clinical studies today showing its impact 
shawn;00:03:34;on oxygenating your blood, boosting stamina, improving your insulin sensitivity 
shawn;00:03:39;which means less belly fat, it's really powerful stuff. 
shawn;00:03:42;We're talking about cordyceps mushroom 
shawn;00:03:44;and that's the basis of the SHROOM Tech formula so those are two incredible things.
shawn;00:03:48;They've got a lot more so head over there 
shawn;00:03:49;and check them out, onnit.com/model for 10% off.
shawn;00:03:53;Now let's get into the iTunes review of the week
shawn;00:03:55;Here's a five-star rating Shawn which we so love to receive. 
shawn;00:03:59;It says, 'Awesome podcast. One of the best.' From Howard H.
shawn;00:04:04;'I heard an interview of Shawn on the Smart Passive Income podcast.
shawn;00:04:07;I was so glad I started listening. 
shawn;00:04:09;I bought his Sleep Smarter book twice, 
shawn;00:04:11;one for me and the other for my daughter.
shawn;00:04:14;I've been enjoying his podcast from the first one. 
shawn;00:04:17;There is so much good information that I can't stop listening.'
shawn;00:04:21;Wow, that is incredible.
Jade;00:04:22;That worked.
shawn;00:04:23;That's incredible. Spreading the love.
Jade;00:04:24;Yes.
shawn;00:04:25;The LUV. I love it. Thank you so much. 
shawn;00:04:28;Thank you so much for leaving that review 
shawn;00:04:29;and everybody thanks for heading over to iTunes 
shawn;00:04:31;and leaving reviews for the show. 
shawn;00:04:33;That means so much. 
shawn;00:04:35;It makes my day every single time I open those up 
shawn;00:04:40;we’re going to talk about what is testosterone in the first place.
Jade;00:04:43;We’ve got to define it. And if it’s such a widespread problem, this is…we need to know.
shawn;00:04:49;So testosterone is essentially a steroid hormone.
shawn;00:04:52;It’s part of an androgen group. The androgen groups are essentially
shawn;00:04:57;known as the male hormones. This is what makes men more masculine and 
shawn;00:05:01;also helps to facilitate a lot of other functions in females as well.
shawn;00:05:06;Testosterone is secreted primarily by the testicles of males and the ovaries of females.
shawn;00:05:12;But a small amount is secreted from the adrenal glands as well. 
shawn;00:05:16;Okay, so now that we’ve gotten a little bit of a definition let’s talk about what testosterone does.
shawn;00:05:20;So, testosterone really, the most important, fundamental thing is that before birth 
shawn;00:05:25;it determines whether or not a baby will develop into a boy or a girl.
Jade;00:05:28;How about that.
shawn;00:05:30;Now a lot of people don’t realize this but we all start off as girls. 
shawn;00:05:36;We all start off in the womb…
Jade;00:05:37;Who runs the world, girls, who runs the world, girls.
shawn;00:05:39;Cue Beyoncé. We all start off in the womb with the female template.
Jade;00:05:43;How about that.
shawn;00:05:45;So basically, after the egg gets fertilized, the sperm and egg meet,
shawn;00:05:48;there are different phases, the zygote, fetus, and this whole thing. 
shawn;00:05:51;But there comes a point where there’s a big shed of testosterone 
shawn;00:05:55;from the mother to the fetus that results in the dropping down of the testicles. 
shawn;00:06:00;Basically, for women, the ovaries kind of stay up there. 
shawn;00:06:03;For guys, they drop down and become the testicles.
Jade;00:06:06;That is so amazing.
shawn;00:06:07;Isn’t that crazy?
Jade;00:06:08;It is crazy. So they’re the same thing, just an innie and an outie.
shawn;00:06:12;Exactly! And one of them is more dangerous. Out in the world you’ve got 
shawn;00:06:16;to protect them. It’s a whole different ballgame.
Jade;00:06:18;Which goes back to that valuable womb.
shawn;00:06:21;And also, this is the sprouting or the birth of the penis as well due to that. 
shawn;00:06:25;And, of course, the different chromosome is determined by the father 
shawn;00:06:30;but the testosterone level in the mother is also important in how
shawn;00:06:33;big these things get or how much testosterone the baby is going to have.
shawn;00:06:37;So it all kind of sets your template early in life as to what your genetic
shawn;00:06:41;disposition is going to be. However, with that said, genes only play a 
shawn;00:06:44;certain percentage of the role in your testosterone because you have a lot
shawn;00:06:48;of influence in your testosterone levels in what you do in your day to day life.
shawn;00:06:53;Just to make that kind of short and sweet and to end it right there 
shawn;00:06:55;because we could talk about that the entire show, is that
shawn;00:06:58;testosterone is literally what makes you a male when you’re developing.
Jade;00:07:00;Sure, but then it continues to be an influence throughout your lifetime,
Jade;00:07:05;that we have some more control over.
shawn;00:07:07;Exactly. And in adult males, their level of testosterone is about 
shawn;00:07:11;seven to eight times greater than adult females.
Jade;00:07:14;Really?
shawn;00:07:15;Now there are different degrees of that depending on where they are 
shawn;00:07:19;in the day, depending on a lot of different factors, because it can 
shawn;00:07:23;be as great as 20 times as much. But still, I want to make the point
shawn;00:07:26;that women have testosterone too and it’s very, very important 
shawn;00:07:30;for your health and longevity.
shawn;00:07:31;So testosterone is also important regulating the sex drive in men and women. 
shawn;00:07:36;It’s important for starting and maintaining the development of male sex 
shawn;00:07:40;characteristics including emotional and physical strength, the body shape,
shawn;00:07:44;hairiness, deepness of the voice, and even the way you smell, your odor. Odor.
shawn;00:07:52;It also governs sperm production and quality. It governs your
shawn;00:07:55;ability to perform during sexual intercourse. Testosterone also
shawn;00:07:59;plays a role in developing your creativity, intellect, and by the way,
shawn;00:08:03;this is all backed by clinical studies. So it has a role in developing
shawn;00:08:07;your creativity, your intellect, your thought patterns, 
shawn;00:08:10;your drive, your assertiveness. We all know this, men and women,
shawn;00:08:14;as well as the ability to propose new ideas and to carry them out to
shawn;00:08:19;their conclusion. So that’s that quality of drive. Are you a driver?
shawn;00:08:24;Testosterone does play a role in that because you can only talk yourself
shawn;00:08:28;up so much. But are you following through? 
shawn;00:08:30;Your testosterone levels could be an influencing player in that.
Jade;00:08:34;That’s very interesting. High five to testosterone for all that.
shawn;00:08:38;Right. Also, testosterone plays a role in bone maturation and bone density.
shawn;00:08:43;Also, your muscle mass. This is captain obvious here
shawn;00:08:45;A lot of people know that one. Protein synthesis.
shawn;00:08:48;So your body actually building things, breaking down proteins and making it
shawn;00:08:52;into other stuff. That is so critical. You are a protein being. 
shawn;00:08:55;Testosterone plays a role in this.
shawn;00:08:57;It is also a regulator of cognitive and physical energy. So, like your
shawn;00:09:01;brain health. We’re also going to talk about some of the negative things
shawn;00:09:03;if you don’t have optimal testosterone levels. Testosterone is also responsible
shawn;00:09:08;for acute stress response. So, how are you under stress.
shawn;00:09:11;How are you reacting? Are you going to be more driven to get things done,
shawn;00:09:15;to accomplish that goal even when stress shows up,or are you going to retreat?
shawn;00:09:19;Your testosterone does have a huge impact on that.
shawn;00:09:23;So now that you know a little bit about what testosterone does in your
shawn;00:09:26;body and in your friends’ body, your partner, mother, father, brother,
shawn;00:09:31;everybody that you know, it’s impacting them. Now that you understand a little
shawn;00:09:34;bit about what it does I’m going to share with you the process of how
shawn;00:09:38;it’s actually created. Now you’ve got to get your science pants on. 
shawn;00:09:41;Get your pocket protector. No, we’re not going to make it too complicated.
shawn;00:09:44;But I am going to take you through the biochemical process here.
shawn;00:09:46;Now here’s what low testosterone can mean for your. According to 
shawn;00:09:48;clinical studies, men whose testosterone levels are slightly above
shawn;00:09:51;average are less likely to have high blood pressure, less likely
shawn;00:09:55;to experience a heart attack, and less likely to be obese.
Jade;00:09:58;Give that man some testosterone then.
shawn;00:10:01;Low testosterone means increased heart disease, increased osteoporosis,
shawn;00:10:07;diabetes, brain aging. This is seen in the research, accelerated
shawn;00:10:13;brain aging form low testosterone, and shorter life span. Now, 
shawn;00:10:18;infertility and poor reproductive health also mean more belly fat and
shawn;00:10:22;total body fat compared to your lean muscle mass, less muscle growth from the
shawn;00:10:26;strength training you’re doing. So, if you’re out there busting it and working out
shawn;00:10:30;and training and not really getting the results it might be something to consider
shawn;00:10:34;that your testosterone might be low.
shawn;00:10:36;Also, obviously, poorer athletic performance. So, your athletic performance
shawn;00:10:40;will suffer because you don’t have that drive, you don’t have that extra gear.
shawn;00:10:43;You also have slower recovery from your intense training. And, the headline here
shawn;00:10:48;is that you’ll have a greater risk of cancer when testosterone levels are low.
shawn;00:10:54;So，let’s talk about some of the things that can lower the testosterone.
shawn;00:10:57;First, we’ll start with some of the obvious stuff. The testosterone
shawn;00:11:00;can be damaged, especially leydig cells, during sports or other physical trauma.
shawn;00:11:07;So, if any guy out there, which pretty much all of us have had that 
shawn;00:11:11;experience of getting nailed in the balls and it’s like...
Jade;00:11:15;Does it really hurt like that? I mean, it hurts like that?
shawn;00:11:19;It feels like somebody is choking you out. It’s so crazy
shawn;00:11:22;how it’s connected. It’s pretty bad.
shawn;00:11:25;Well, if the testicles are...You are doing the hands like....
Jade;00:11:31;Maybe I should change the shape. Well, if the testicles are similar to our
Jade;00:11:38;ovaries except that yours are exposed to dangerous environmental factors
Jade;00:11:44;and trauma then the only thing I can equate the pain that
Jade;00:11:48;you are describing to is maybe our monthly cramping that happens.
shawn;00:11:52;You know, the thing is, if you look into this you really can’t find a comparison.
Jade;00:11:56;There’s not, huh? Men are from Mars, women are from Venus?
shawn;00:11:59;Right. We will never really understand, because we have not gone through it.
Jade;00:12:04;Sure
shawn;00:12:05;And you guys can’t really understand what it’s like for us as well.
Jade;00:12:06;And there’s no language to...
shawn;00:12:07;Nobody’s pain is more important.
Jade;00:12:11;No, no-no-no. Who would even bring up childbirth and all that stuff.
Jade;00:12:16;We wouldn’t even go there.
shawn;00:12:18;Let’s not get into a debate.
Jade;00:12:19;There’s no need.
shawn;00:12:20;So I want people to understand that physical trauma can definitely 
shawn;00:12:24;hinder your testosterone level production for sure.
shawn;00:12:26;So, kids out there who are playing sports, collegiate sports, professional
shawn;00:12:30;athletes, we’ve got some professional athletes who listen to the show, 
shawn;00:12:33;make sure that you wear the protection, okay. 
shawn;00:12:36;Jade just tapped a cup. It was a Styrofoam cup. I don’t know
shawn;00:12:40;where that came from. But, anyway, protect yourself.
Jade;00:12:44;Yes, protect yourself.
shawn;00:12:45;Also, radiation treatment or chemotherapy has been shown, clinically proven,
shawn;00:12:49;to have negative effects on the leydig cells. There we 
shawn;00:12:52;are again about the leydig cells. Vasectomy may damage the leydig cells and
shawn;00:12:57;lead to early andropause and low testosterone levels. Several studies have shown
shawn;00:13:02;this. So you’ve got to be careful when we’re making that decision about
shawn;00:13:05;getting the vasectomy, getting the little clippie clippie so we don’t have
shawn;00:13:09;any more babies, because you could be potentially lowering your testosterone levels.
Jade;00:13:13;Right, try another way.
shawn;00:13:14;Yeah. We’ve actually talked about some natural birth control methods
shawn;00:13:19;on the show with Sara Gottfried.	
Jade;00:13:21;We did.
shawn;00:13:22;But this is again, understanding we want to things as natural as possible.
shawn;00:13:27;Surgery should be far down the line as an option for you because 
shawn;00:13:32;every surgery is a traumatic even for the human body.
shawn;00:13:35;Your body is not designed to be cut into so just understand that.
Jade;00:13:39;We are finding more and more just how much trauma affects our well being.
shawn;00:13:44;Yeah, If you’ve got neighbors who it’s not going to really work for that’s 
shawn;00:13:48;something you’ve got to consider maybe doing a different way but
shawn;00:13:52;I’m just giving you the data here. Sunlight on the testicles directly
shawn;00:13:55;can boost your testosterone even more so than getting it on 
shawn;00:13:59;your other body parts.
Jade;00:14:00;So let the sunshine in. 
shawn;00:14:03;That’s tip number one to naturally boost your testosterone, get
shawn;00:14:06;more sunlight. Tip number two is to lift heavy weights.
shawn;00:14:10;This is the well-known one. This is known across the board 
shawn;00:14:12;so we’re not going to spend a lot of time here, but heavy lifts. 
shawn;00:14:14;We’re talking about doing heavy lifting here. So, especially
shawn;00:14:18;the compound lifts, the dead lifts, the squats, overhead press, bench press.
shawn;00:14:23;These are going to trigger your body to secrete the most anabolic hormones. 
shawn;00:14:27;So these lifts are critical to secreting testosterone. So the dead lift
shawn;00:14:33;the squats, bench press, and overhead press, and anything that you’re
shawn;00:14:37;putting a heavy load on your body., so this is gonna be the thing...
shawn;00:14:42;Number three on our ten ways to naturally boost testosterone is sex. 
Jade;00:14:47;There you go.
shawn;00:14:48;Orgasm does not actually affect testosterone levels in the blood in
shawn;00:14:53;an acute sense. So, just the short-term secretion, because 
shawn;00:14:58;a lot of guys are actually concerned that there is a lot of information
shawn;00:15:01;out there, even movies saying you can’t do it when you are training for
shawn;00:15:05;your event because you are going to depress your drive because our drive is
shawn;00:15:09;related to our testosterone. But there is not really much data to back that up.
