Found 'Value'
Jump ahead 2 addresses to define functName
Jump ahead 14 addresses to get first variable name, add to varNames() array
**	jump ahead 5 addresses, break up the values block for actual values
		block.split(',') and take final array item and call it the
value
		store value in an array initialized for each new varName

Jump ahead 4 to next variable name and repeat from ** to here

//Create out object
